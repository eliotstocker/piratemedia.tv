## Profile

Over the past 13+ years I have built companies, teams, and platforms of all sizes, from small 3 man teams and start-ups, through to multi team groups within scale ups.

Initially coming from a background in music production, I bring a different perspective to software engineering from this non traditional background. Many of my roles to date have focused on media, and providing a great developer experience both internally and to third parties, bringing in the valuable skills I gained working in the media and communications industries.

Platform and Contracts are words that I'm sure many have tired of hearing from me, but I have a strong belief that building strong contracts between systems, as well as the teams building them, nurtures the most effective and efficient engineering organisations, good documentation, APIs and extensibility are key to engineering efficiency and a cohesive platform both internally and externally.

My passion is communication, I believe that a message communicated the right way can be so much louder. Weather the medium be video, innfographic, auido, or text. When effort is put into the style and presentation of your output, people want to listen and engage.

Whilst my focus is on leadership, I'm not at all afraid to get my hands dirty, you won't find me shying away from helping members of my teams solve a complex problem.

## Outside of Work

I contribute to a number of open source communities, mostly in recent years IoT applications and drivers for systems like SmartThings and Hubitat. Not only do I enjoy giving back to the open source community, this keeps my coding knowledge up-to-date as I less frequently find myself writing code in my roles recently.

My wife and I are avid climbers. You will find me at the local bouldering gym at least 3 times a week, and not as frequently as I'd like at one of the southeast's great crags.

Cooking, and food and drink in general are a passion of mine, I will often spend hours in the kitchen slow roasting, sous viding and smoking various ingredients into submission, or making a fine espresso based drink.

Photography, videography and video editing are something that I enjoy doing when I get time, along with some cinematic drone photography. I have been known to bring this into my work when appropriate.

Coming originally from a music production background, you will often find me jamming out in my studio recording something weird with various instruments, effects and software.
