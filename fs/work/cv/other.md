## Profile

Initially coming from a background in music production, I bring a different perspective to software engineering. Many of my roles to date have focussed on media and providing a great developer experience both internally and for third parties.

Platform is a world that I'm sure many have tired of hearing from me, but I have a strong belief that building strong contracts between systems (as well as the teams building them) nurtures the most effective and efficient engineering organisations, good documentation, APIs and extensibility are key to engineering efficiency.

My passion is communication, be that Zoom calls, creating video content for consumption by my colleagues (an "Eliot style video" has been used a number of times to describe a short team update at Brandwatch), or in person get-togethers, this is where I thrive.

Whilst my focus is on leadership, I'm not at all afraid to get my hands dirty, you won't find me shying away from helping members of my teams solve a complex coding problem.

## Outside of Work

I contribute to a number of open source communities, mostly in recent years IOT applications and drivers for systems like SmartThings and Hubitat. Not only do I enjoy giving back to the open source community, this keeps my coding knowledge up-to-date as I rarely find myself writing code in my current role.

My wife and I are avid climbers. You will find me at the local bouldering gym at least 3 times a week, and not as frequently as I'd like at one of the southeast's great crags.

Cooking and food in general are a passion of mine, I will often spend hours in the kitchen slow roasting, sous videing and smoking various ingredients into submission.

Photography, videography and video editing are something that I enjoy doing when I get time, along with some cinematic drone photography. I have been known to bring this into my work when appropriate.

Coming originally from a music production background, you will often find me jamming out in my studio recording something weird with various instruments, effects and software.
