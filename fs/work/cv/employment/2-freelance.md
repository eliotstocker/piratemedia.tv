## Positions Held
* Self Employed: May 2016 - Dec 2017

## Role
After leaving Noonan Media I wanted to go it alone for a while and focus on project-based work whilst forging new long-lasting relationships with clients.

I was able to take my experience of working directly with clients in previous roles and transform that into a successful freelance business where I was able to build up a roster of frequently returning client for software engineering and consultancy work.

Much of the work I took on was centered around infrastructure consultancy, platform development, and research and development.

I was lucky to work on quite a range of products and technologies, including Java, PHP, NodeJS, SQL, C++, Unity and more.

Working as a freelancer, I met the team from RTObjects when they engaged me to do the initial research and development for their platform, at which stage they had a rough proof of concept.
