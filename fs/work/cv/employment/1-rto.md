This exciting and challenging relationship began when I was engaged by the company as a freelance consultant. The task was that of an R&D project to help design the basis of a fully interactive hyper real-time streaming solution, delivered from the cloud to any device in browser. After working with the team at RTObjects for a year as a freelancer, I was asked to join the team in the permanent position of CTO.

As a member of a small team, my responsibilities were wide-ranging, from documenting IP for patents etc, to leading the developement of core technology for the platform and managing the in house creative and development team as well as contractors.

Outside of development and resource management, I also frequently attended client meetings to discuss technical needs and implementation. Alos meeting regularly with investors to provided them with technology and company developments updates.
