## Positions Held
* Chief Technical Officer: Jun 2017 - Aug 2018

## Company
Founded by games industry veterans from BigBit Games and Black Rock Studios, and backed by [Collider Accelerator](https://www.collider.io/) this AdTech startup built a Real-time 3D application streaming platform, delivering 3D interactive visuals from existing game engines (Unity, Unreal, and more) to an engaged audience, in adverts, webpages, and in app.

## Stack
A frontend JavaScript client library for embedding into websites and apps this interacted with a Routing and analytic API layer witten in PHP, responsible for routing incoming traffic from the frontend to specific servers with availability to stream the requested application.

A scalable Ansible Windows Server deployment system running a custom Java application server, connecting directly to frontend users over one of a number of protocols providing hyper low latency streams and listening for user input.

On the content creation side we built a unity implementation library written in c# to allow direct control from the client, this allows mouse/keyboard input as well as direct API integration (for instance a web interface could pick a colour which could then be applied to a shader in engine). A toolset was also built for Unreal and generic binary applications.

## Role
This exciting and challenging relationship began when I was engaged by the company as a consultant. The R&D project was to help design the basis of a fully interactive real-time streaming solution, delivered from the cloud to any device in browser. After working with RTObjects for a year as a freelancer, I was asked to join the team in the permanent position of CTO.

As a member of a small team, my responsibilities were wide-ranging, from documenting IP for patents etc, to leading the development of core technology for the platform and managing the in house creative and development team as well as contractors.

Outside of development and resource management, I also frequently attended client meetings to discuss technical needs and implementation. Also meeting regularly with investors to provided them with technology and company developments updates.
