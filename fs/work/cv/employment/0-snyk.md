## Positions Held
* __Senior Engineering Manager__: Feb 2022 - Present

## Company
The name in developer-first security tooling, Snyk is a unicorn startup that has achieved so much in its first 7 years and has grown to become a very well-used suite of tools within the engineering community.
Whilst my time at Snyk has been relatively short, I'm happy to have been able to work with such an amazing global pool of talent.
Snyk is the fastest-paced organisation that I have worked in, and I found many lessons in the challenges, changes and problems that Hypergrowth in these types of scaleups bring.

## Stack
The Snyk platform primarily consists of JavaScript/TypeScript, Node JavaScript and Golang with PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Kafka. I have mostly worked with teams in the Golang, Envoy Proxy, Kafka, Terraform, and Kubernetes spaces, but have also touched areas such as Typescript, PostgreSQL, Big Query and more.

## Role
Over my time at  Snyk I managed several teams, under a number of directors.
Upon starting at Snyk I was tasked with managing an established team of engineers focused on internal tools, and responsible for platform governance.
I was later asked to help form the Foundation group focusing on foundational platform-wide technologies such as authorisation, authentication, inter-service communication, and more. Here I took on the role of building and managing two of the group's three new teams.
Most recently the Data Infrastructure team that I had created in Foundation moved into a new group in order to help establish a vertically integrated data pipeline along with the Data Products division, with a view to enabling internal engineers to more easily visualise and report on data flowing through the platform.

Unfortunately due to changes in the economic landscape, Snyk had to make some hard cuts of ≈15% of its workforce at the end of 2022, and I was affected by these changes.
