## Positions Held
* __Senior Engineering Manager__: Feb 2022 - Present

## Company
The name in developer first security tooling, Snyk is a unicorm startup that has achived so much in its first 7 years and grown to become a very well used suite of tools within the engineering community.
Whilst my time at Snyk has been relatively short, I'm happy to have been able to work with such an amazing global pool of tallent.
Snyk is the fastest paced organisation that I have worked in, and I found many lessons in the callenges, changes and problems that Hypergrowth in these types of scale ups brinng.

## Stack
The Snyk platform primarily consists of JavaScript/TypeScript, Node JS and Golang with PostgreSQL, Mongo DB and Kafka. I have primarily worked with teams in the Golang, Envoy Proxy, Kafka, Terraform, and Kubernetes spaces, but have also touched areas such as Typescript, PostgreSQL, Big Query and more.

## Role
Over my time at  Snyk I managed a number of different teams, under a number of different directors.
Upon starting at Snyk I ran a team of engineers focussed on internal tools, and responsible for platform governance.
I later helped to form the current incarnation of the Foundation group focusing of foundation technologies such and Authorisation, Authentication, Interservice communicationn and more. It was here in foundation that I Ran two of the groups three teams for a time.
Most recently the Data Infrastucture team that I ran in Foundation moved into the Data Products group in order to help establish a vertically integrated data pipeline from events through to visulaisation.

Unfortunatelty due to changes in the economic landscape Snyk had to make some hard cuts of ≈15% of its workforce at the end of 2022, and I was affected by these changes.
