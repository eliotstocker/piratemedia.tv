## Positions Held
* Chief Technical Officer: Dec 2012 - May 2016
* Head of Engineering: Nov 2010 - Dec 2012

## Company
A multimedia platform ingesting text, image, video and audio, both live and on demand.
The company’s main product was a live video and audio production suite. This cloud tool allowed live production of a video or audio “channels” including live and uploaded content ingestion, overlays, and more.

## Stack
Noonan Media's Multimedia platform utilised a PHP backend with MongoDB data storage backed by Elasticsearch indexing, A custom Java real-time data ingestion pipeline was created by myself and the team to maintain up-to-date and performant indexing and long term storage.
Applications ingesting and consuming content were created for iOS, Android, Windows and MacOS, some utilising the Apache Flex cross-platform development framework and others developed with native code. For instance, Objective C for iOS and Java on Android.
Servers were orchestrated with Chef with custom autoscaling to meet the constantly changing demand on servers.

## Role
When I began this long-term role in 2010 the company had a very small stack of technology, these were mainly hardware boxes to live stream audio from live music venues to the web. Initially my role was to oversee updating existing interfaces and overhaul the full user experience to make the user journey more fluid.

Over-time, it became clear that hardware was not a great focus, so myself and the other board members decided to pivot the company towards creating cloud and mobile app based streaming solutions.

I was responsible for a team of iOS, Android, Frontend, API, and Backend developers, both in-house and contractors. We architected, built and deployed a next generation media platform, one that would be content agnostic, pulling in audio, video, text and images, live or on demand.

whilst much of my time was spent meeting clients, with the board and managing a growing engineering team. I was also still able to spend some time on the ground with the team helping solve hard architectural and coding problems and leading from the front.
