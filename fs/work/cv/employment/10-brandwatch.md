## Positions Held
* __Director of Engineering__: Oct 2019 - Jan 2022
* __Senior Software Engineer__: Aug 2018 - Oct 2019

## Company
One of the big names in social listening, I have grown with the company. From joining in 2018 there were around 200-250 people worldwide, through to merging with Crimson Hexagon in 2019 when the company nearly doubled in size, through to the company being acquired by Cision in 2021 joining a workforce of over 5000, over 1000+ of whom which landing in the Brandwatch Social Division.
Being the largest company I had worked for to date, I was fortunate enough to work with many great people around the world, across multiple products, and technologies.

## Stack
The Brandwatch stack is large and varied, I have mostly spent my time in JavaScript, Java, Kubernetes, Docker and PostgreSQL based software engineering whilst at Brandwatch, but also brushing up against some Python, Go, Lucene and other technologies withing my time at the company.
One example stack within the organisation is for a product called "Vizia". This consists of a micro-service architecture of mostly NodeJS backend services and React Frontends, with PostgreSQL and Redis for data storage. All of this is deployed to Kubernetes on Google Kubernetes Engine, with test, build and deployment running in Concourse from a Github hosted monorepo.

## Role
I joined as a Senior Engineer to look at some low level technical problems, and gain better insight into the organisation as a whole. This was great to get a real understanding of the core technologies that Brandwatch products are built on, and appreciate what it takes to build and support an applications of this maturity and scale.
I spent some time thinking hard about devex, completely rebuilding both the devops pipelines and the developer experience for the widget system within the "Vizia" product. After a year contributing individually it was clear that it was time to get back into Leadership. I was very fortunate to be trusted to take on the team that I had been a part of as Director of Engineering.

Over time this role morphed into Directing the overall pushed and shared insights technical strategy within Brandwatch. This having teams focused on both [Vizia](https://www.brandwatch.com/products/vizia/) and parts of the [Consumer Research](https://www.brandwatch.com/products/consumer-research/) product, this role was very varied, including everything from large architectural decisions all the way down the managing day to day bug fixes and tweaks. Managing this tribe felt like a good fit for my technical, architectural, and leadership skills.

In early 2021 engineering re-organised, at this time that I was thinking a lot about organisational efficiency and how better resource internal developer experience. After working with leadership and writing a number of proposals we created the Developer Platform tribe, reporting directly to the CTO, focusing on CI/CD, observability and tooling at first with scope to move beyond this in the future.
